# React Firebase with Hooks example

Example of implementing Firebase authentication with React hooks. Only sign-in and sign-out are implemented.

Using create-react-app, react-router and firebase.

This is my first React app so don't use this if you stumble upon it, you can improve it first. I'm also new to programming in general. You can find similar implementation (on which this one is based on) from an experienced developer here: https://github.com/taming-the-state-in-react/react-firebase-authentication

I might delete the above warnings when I'm confident enough.
